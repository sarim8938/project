                    <h2>Case Title 2:2 brothers beaten to death for parking over disputed land in Kanpur</h2>
                    <h3>Brief summary of the case...</h3>
                    <p>Two brothers were allegedly beaten to death after a fight over parking on disputed land in Kanpur Dehat, police said on Friday.


                        A fight broke out between the parties over parking a pick-up loader on the disputed plot. 
                        
                        Two brothers were allegedly beaten to death and their four family members, including women, were seriously injured after a fight over parking on disputed land in Kanpur Dehat, police said on Friday.
                        
                        The victims, identified as Rambir and Satnarayan, had long-held possession of land which Mohanlal of the same village claimed as his own.
                        
                        According to locals, Satnarayan had reportedly bought the land from Shankar Bani, who had verbally purchased it from Mohanlal's grandfather, Rajola Shukla.
                        
                        However, no paperwork was done during these transactions, and the land was still registered in the name of Mohanlal's grandfather in official documents.
                        
                        Mohanlal later reportedly signed the sale of deed with his father Prem Narayan and uncle Uday Narayan. Following this, on September 30, he filed a complaint against illegal possession and construction on the disputed land.
                        
                        Mohanlal in his complaint letter alleged that no police action was taken on his complaint.
                        
                        The double-murder happened on Thursday, after a fight broke out between the parties over parking a pick-up loader on the disputed plot.</p>
