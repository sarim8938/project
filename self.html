                    <p>Set goals that are in line with your life purpose.  All your life goals (such as family, wellness, career, personal development, and so on) need to be cohesive and support each other for long-term benefits.

                        Have a well-organized to-do and not-to-do list, keep your desk ready for productive work, place stationery where it’s handy, and so on.  The point is that having the right attitude will help you remain focused on important matters....</p>
